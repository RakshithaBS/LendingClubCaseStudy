# Lending Club Case Study 
> This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis on the lending club dataset. The analysis is to identify variables that help to detect if a borrower is likely to default. Digital Lending companies need to analyse the customer's profile before approving the loan. This is also called risk analysis. There are two types risks associated with lending use case:

  * If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

  * If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
